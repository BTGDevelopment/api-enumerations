# api-enumerations

This repository is a clone of git@github.com:companieshouse/api-enumerations.git.

As we are importing this repository as a submodule within git, it makes sense to only import a clone of the repository that we can clone.  That way we don't lose the ability to build or deploy new servers if the companies house repository no longer exists.
